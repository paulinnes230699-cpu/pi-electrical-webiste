                  over {BUSINESS.facts.fullyQualifiedYears} years, working across

                  Public liability insurance is held to {BUSINESS.facts.publicLiability}
                  , and where certification is required for the electrical work
                  completed, the relevant certificates are provided. Quotes are
                  free and carry no obligation, and there is no job too small.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The work spans everything from changing a socket through to
                  full rewires, kitchen installations, extensions, new builds and
                  commercial fit-outs, alongside fault finding, EICRs, PAT
                  testing and emergency call-outs accepted day and night.
