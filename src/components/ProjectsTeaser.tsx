/**
 * Projects teaser for the homepage.
 *
 * There are no project photographs yet, so this does NOT render a grid of
 * empty, invented project cards. It renders an honest band: a single labelled
 * slot plus a statement of what the gallery will hold, and a link to the full
 * Projects & About page.
 *
 * The alternative - a masonry of grey boxes captioned with guessed project
 * names - would be fabricated evidence. That is the one thing this site must
 * never do.
