/**
 * Brand lockup: circular logo mark + typographic brand name.
 *
 * WHY A DISC, AND WHY IT IS BLACK
 * -------------------------------
 * The supplied artwork is an RGB PNG with a solid black background and no alpha
 * channel. The black cannot be knocked out programmatically, because the mark
 * contains roughly 13,900 black pixels of its OWN internal detail (the gaps and
 * strokes inside the bolt) - a luminance key would punch holes straight through
 * it. So the circle is produced by clipping the black square with
 * `rounded-full`, which leaves a black roundel with the green bolt inside it.
 * No image processing, and the artwork stays pixel-identical.
 *
 * SAFE TO CROP: the bolt's bounding box is 763x985 inside the 1254x1254 square,
 * and its furthest point sits 531px from the centre - comfortably inside the
 * inscribed circle (r=627). A circular crop therefore loses no artwork.
 *
 * DO NOT SCALE THE IMAGE INSIDE THE DISC past 1.18x. At 1x the bolt already
 * fills 78.5% of the disc, which is the right proportion for a roundel; any
 * inner scaling would push the bolt's top tip past the clip.
 *
 * The bolt is `alt=""` on purpose. It is decorative next to the visible
 * "PI Electrical" text, and both call sites wrap this in a Link with an
 * explicit `aria-label`, so a real alt value would only create a duplicate
 * announcement.
 *
 * SURFACES
 * The header is light, so the disc reads as a solid badge. The footer is
 * `bg-black`, where a black disc would disappear, so dark surfaces get a
 * hairline inset ring and the circle still reads as a badge.
 *
 * SWAPPING IN A FULL LOCKUP
 * -------------------------
 * Set `logoImage` below to a path such as "/images/logo-transparent.png" and
 * this renders that wide lockup instead of the disc + text. The supplied logo
 * artwork must be transparent and high enough resolution; do not trace or
 * recreate the mark in CSS.
