/**
 * ============================================================================
 * AUTO-ADVANCING HORIZONTAL STRIP
 * ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Steps a snap-scrolled list forward one item at a time on its own, so the
 * items nobody would otherwise swipe to advertise themselves.
 *
 * Built for the QuickActions band under the hero. Framework-free in the same
 * way as lib/scroll-past.ts and lib/overlay.ts: it drives DOM scroll position
 * and knows nothing about the list it is driving.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * PAUSE IS NOT STOP
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Two different things, and conflating them is the bug this design avoids.
 *
 * PAUSE (resumable). The tab is hidden, the viewport is desktop-sized, or the
 * visitor prefers reduced motion. Nothing about the visitor's intent changed,
 * so the loop picks up again.
 *
 * STOP (permanent). The visitor touched, focused, or scrolled the strip. At that
 * point they are driving, and the strip must never move again on its own. This
 * is the mis-tap guard: a tile shifting under a finger that is reaching for it
 * is how someone ends up tapping "Emergency" when they meant "Free quote".
 *
 * Note what is NOT a pause: the strip being scrolled out of view. It cycles from
 * page load. The homepage hero is about 1435px tall on a phone, so the band does
 * not appear until roughly 600px of scrolling, and gating the loop on visibility
 * made the feature look entirely dead - you had to already be looking at the
 * band for it to move. Cycling up front means it is turning by the time it is
 * reached. The trade is that the tile a visitor arrives at is whichever one the
 * loop happens to be on, rather than always "Call Paul".
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * ACCESSIBILITY: A KNOWN, DELIBERATE WCAG 2.2.2 DEVIATION
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * This is auto-moving content that runs for more than five seconds, and the
 * stop is incidental - the visitor has to happen to interact - rather than an
 * explicit control. WCAG 2.2.2 asks for a mechanism to pause, stop, or hide it,
 * so this does not comply. That is a known, accepted trade-off rather than an
 * oversight, taken to keep the band free of a pause button.
 *
 * What is done to limit the harm: it is phone-only (the desktop layout is a
 * static grid with nothing to scroll), it pauses when the tab is hidden, it
 * pauses while an overlay has the page inert, it never runs under reduced
 * motion, one loop is about twenty seconds, and any interaction stops it for
 * good.
 *
 * If this ever needs to comply, the change is small: expose `stopped` and render
 * a play/pause button beside the indicators. The stop machinery is already here.
 * ============================================================================

   *   jump to position zero. It shows every photograph exactly once and trades
   *   the seamlessness for not looking broken.
   *
   * Stepping back off the first slide needs neither trick. The last real slide
   * is already there to step back to, so both modes just target it.
