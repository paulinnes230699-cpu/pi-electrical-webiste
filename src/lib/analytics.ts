/**
 * ============================================================================
 * ANALYTICS
 * ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Google Analytics 4 (tag G-5SXH1G36RR) is loaded via `@next/third-parties`
 * in the root layout, with the client's explicit instruction. Its gtag.js
 * reads this same `window.dataLayer`, so `track()` events now flow into GA4
 * automatically. Events also dispatch a `pi:track` CustomEvent, so either
 * mechanism can pick them up.
 *
 * PRIVACY - IMPORTANT
 * -------------------
 * `track()` accepts only a fixed event name and a small allowlist of
 * non-identifying context. There is deliberately no way to pass form
 * content. Job descriptions, postcodes, names, phone numbers and email
 * addresses are NEVER sent to analytics - see the type signature, which
 * makes that a compile error rather than a code-review catch.
 * ============================================================================
