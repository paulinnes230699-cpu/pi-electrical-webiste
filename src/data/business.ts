   * VERIFIED FACTS (confirmed by Paul / PI Electrical).

   * Phrasing rule enforced across the site: the five years refers to how long
   * Paul has been FULLY QUALIFIED. It is never rendered as "5 years in
   * business" or a bare "5 years' experience", which would read as time
   * trading and would be a different claim.
   *
   * Written as "5+" / "over 5" rather than a flat "5", so the claim is a floor
   * and not a ceiling. It does not need re-editing every year, and it stays
   * true as the real figure grows. The number itself stays single-sourced on
   * `fullyQualifiedYears` - never type the 5 again in copy.
